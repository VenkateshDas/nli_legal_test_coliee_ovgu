--------------------------NO FILES SAVED IN THIS FOLDER--------------------------

This README is used to maintain the folder structure in git. 
Git won't accept empty folders.

The folder is empty either because,
	1. The data/logs/models/states are too big in size to be uploaded.
	2. The data/logs/models/states can be saved upon new training. And not something very needed right now. Because we have not started actual training.
	
If this README comes within the 'data' directory, you will have to download those files:
	1. Law2Vec100d.txt, Law2Vec200.txt
	2. Google News Vectors Negative 300d. This file will automatically download from the program if it does not exist in the directory.

If this README comes within other folders, do not worry. 
	Please make sure you have all those folders that comply to the folder structure as shown in git.
	The programs will automatically save it to this folder upon execution
