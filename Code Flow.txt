1. Preprocess raw training set and save it to local: preprocessing_sabines_dataset.py
	1.1 Set path of Sabine_training_data.xml to RAW_TRAIN_DATA variable in preprocessing_sabines_dataset.py
	1.2 Run preprocessing_sabines_dataset.py and output json file will be saved to local

2. Train LSTM model using the preprocessed json training set saved in step 1.2 : training.py
	2.1 Set path for all required variables if necessary. Otherwise models, states and logs get saved to already mentioned relative path.
	2.2 Run training.py and models at various will be saved to local

3. Test LSTM model using Test set: test.py
	3.1 Set path for RAW_TEST_DATA, LABELS_FILE & MODEL_FILE - MODEL_FILE path refers to which model you want to test from the 'models' folder
	3.2 Open 'checkpoint' file in 'models' folder. 
		3.2.1 Copy the same model for which the MODEL_FILE was set to.
		3.2.2 Replace the model written in quotes in the first line of this file with the copied model
		The first line mentions the latest checkpoint. When we call the latest checkpoint in our program, it should be same as that of MODEL_FILE.
		Otherwise, the saved tensor graph and tensor variables won't match.


===========================================================================================================================================================

NOTE:
* Step 1 needs to be run only once 
* In order to train each time, start from step 2 if step 1 ran atleast once. 
* Make sure the required MODEL_FILE and latest checkpoint model matches before executing step 3
